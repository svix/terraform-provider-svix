# svix_event_type_openapi_import (Resource)

Given an OpenAPI spec, create new or update existing event types. If an existing `archived` event type is updated, it will be unarchived.

The importer will convert all webhooks found in the either the `webhooks` or `x-webhooks` top-level.

Import a list of event types from webhooks defined in an OpenAPI spec.

The OpenAPI spec is specified in the `raw_spec` field a YAML or JSON string

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "svix_environment" "example_environment" {
  name = "Staging env"
  type = "development"
}


resource "svix_event_type_openapi_import" "event_types" {
  environment_id = svix_environment.example_environment.id
  spec_raw       = file("${path.module}/openapi.json")
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The Id to the environment that this resource will be created in
- `spec_raw` (String) A string, parsed by the server as YAML or JSON.

If the spec includes event types already defined (either by using terraform, the API, or the frontend), they will be overwritten

### Optional

- `replace_all` (Boolean) Default `false`. If `true`, all existing event types that are not in the spec will be archived.

### Read-Only

- `created_event_types` (List of String) List of the created event types
